    "abstract": "We apply reinforcement learning techniques to topic modeling by replacing the variational autoencoder in ProdLDA with a continuous action space reinforcement learning policy. We train the system with a policy gradient algorithm REINFORCE. Additionally, we introduced several modi\ufb01cations: modernize the neural network architecture, weight the ELBO loss, use contextual embeddings, and monitor the learning process via computing topic diversity and coherence for each training step. Experiments are performed on 11 data sets. Our unsupervised model outperforms all other unsupervised models and performs on par with or better than most models using supervised labeling. Our model is outperformed on certain data sets by a model using supervised labeling and contrastive learning. We have also conducted an ablation study to provide empirical evidence of performance improvements from changes we made to ProdLDA and found that the reinforcement learning formulation boosts performance.",

Topic modeling is a method to extract information from this text by grouping documents into topics and linking these topics with words describing them. Classical techniques for topic modeling, the most popular being Latent Dirichlet Approximation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), have recently begun to be overtaken by Neural Topic Models (NTM) (Zhao et al., 2021).",
                        "ProdLDA (Srivastava and Sutton, 2017) is a NTM using a product of experts in place of the mixture model used in classical LDA. ProdLDA uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma and Welling, 2013) to learn distributions over topics and words. ProdLDA improved on NVDM (Miao et al., 2016) by explicitly approximating the Dirichlet prior from LDA with a Gaussian distribution and using the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a higher momentum and learning rate. Perceiving Reinforcement Learning (RL) as probabilistic inference has brought practices of such an inference into the RL \ufb01eld (Dayan and Hinton, 1997) (Levine, 2018). New algorithms using these techniques include MPO (Abdolmaleki et al., 2018) and VIREL (Fellows et al., 2019). MPO optimizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which is the same optimization objective used in VAEs.",

We use REINFORCE, the simplest policy gradient (PG) algorithm, to train a model which parameterizes a continuous action space, corresponding to the distribution of topics for each document in the topic model. We keep the product of experts from ProdLDA to compute the distribution of words for each document in the topic model.",

The model architecture is shown in Figure 1. Our method outperforms most other topic models. It is beaten only on some data sets by advanced methods using document labels for supervised learning, while our procedure is fully unsupervised."

Our model builds on the ProdLDA model, which uses a product of experts instead of the mixture model used in classical LDA. We improve ProdLDA by adding SBERT embeddings, an RL policy formulation, a weighted ELBO loss, and the improved NN architecture. In addition, we track topic diversity and coherence during a training process rather than only evaluating these metrics for the \ufb01nal model. Our fully unsupervised RL model outperforms most other topic models. It is only topped by contrastive Scholar \u2014a method using supervised labels during training \u2014in a few select cases."

Our RL model also has a higher variance than some other topic models to which we compared. While our RL model performed well on all the data sets tested, this performance may not generalize to different data sets. The insights from the policy dropout sweep conducted may not apply to other topic models. The performance difference for NPMI coherence compared with Bianchi et al. (2020a) may be overstated since the model in that paper used a deprecated SBERT model that produces sentence embeddings of low quality1. For the comparison to Nguyen and Luu (2021), we used slightly different preprocessing than the authors. While the model can work on any languages with associated embedding models, all data sets used in this paper were in English. Our model has additional hyperparameters compared to some other models. So, it may require more tuning and, therefore, more GPU computing. The initial model was developed on a system with 8GB of RAM and a Nvidia GTX 1060 with 3GB of VRAM for a total of approximately 100 GPU hours. A single run of the model for 1000 epochs on this GPU requires less than an hour. Experiments using the New York Times data set were run on a system with 256GB of RAM and a Nvidia RTX 3090 for approximately 100 GPU hours. All other experiments were run on a system with 128GB of RAM and a Nvidia TITAN RTX for approximately 600 GPU hours."

One application is to prevent policy updates from making large changes to the policy that could result in poorer performance. Two algorithms using KL divergence for this are TRPO (Schulman et al., 2015) and MPO (Abdolmaleki et al., 2018). Another application is for optimistic RL (Filippi et al., 2010) (Kobayashi, 2022).

The in\ufb02uence of hyperparameters (e.g. inference network layer sizes) on varied corpora (e.g. those with large vocabularies) could be explored. The Laplace approximation of the Dirichlet prior could be replaced by a true Dirichlet prior, making use of the Dirichlet RT (Figurnov et al., 2018) and a Dirichlet RL policy (Tian et al., 2022).
